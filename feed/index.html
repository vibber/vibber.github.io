This art project was created in collaboration with DIAS Kunsthal for Copenhagen Art Week 2018. I made a Bitcoin treasure hunt.</p>
<p>The clues were placed in different places in the Copenhagen Metro.<br />
Each clue is a collage of images. Put together the collages forms a visual riddle. The first person to solve the riddle gains access to the Bitcoin treasure.</p>
<p>So far the riddle has not been solved. The treasure is still in place waiting for someone to find it. I have put the clues online so that anyone can participate in the treasure hunt.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Volumetric is a utility that converts the volume from your microphone (or another audio input) into MIDI and OSC signals. This behaviour is built into most VJ apps, but it may be handy if you have some software without this functionality. It comes in two flavors. An online version and a standalone app. If you only need MIDI and don&#8217;t care about OSC, simply point your browser (Chrome only at the moment) here: Volumetric online. It will immediately start outputting a MIDI signal that corresponds to the volume level. If you want the full functionality including OSC you can download the free app for Mac and Windows &#8211; download Volumetric. Volumetric is open source and on Github]]></description>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Wikipedia states in their definition of projection mapping:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Projection mapping, also known as video mapping and spatial augmented reality, is a projection technology used to turn objects, often irregularly shaped, into a display surface for video projection. These objects may be complex industrial landscapes, such as buildings.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>With projection mapping one can create interesting visual effects even optical illusions that make the static surface seem to move. Also an important aspect of the experience is the audio that complete the illusion. Many people have seen impressive examples such as this one on a <a href="https://vimeo.com/15749093"  title="clock tower" target="_blank">clock tower</a> </p>
<p>A number of tools exist that aid with the projection mapping. Madmapper, Blendy and TouchDesigner to name a few. These tools help the aligning of the video projection to fit onto the surface. </p>
<p><a href="http://projection-mapping.org/software/"  target="_blank">A list of projection mapping software</a></p>
<p>A mapping tool is not enough however. One will need to prepare graphical content especially tailored to the shape of the projection surface. This will most often be created in a 3d modelling and animation application such as 3D Studio Max, Blender or Cinema4D to name a few. Here a complete 3D model of the chosen surface will be modelled with all visual details.</p>
<h2>Considerations before planning a projection mapping</h2>
<p>Since the content needs to be tailored to the exact shape of the building or the surface one cannot buy ready made loops for projection mapping. Although I have seen this advertised it is fake and will not create the desired illusion.</p>
<p>Projection mapping is a quite expensive form of entertainment. Apart from the cost of creating the graphics (and sound) there is also the cost of renting video projectors. If you&#8217;re projecting outdoors onto a building you will need one or more big projectors (15.000 &#8211; 20.000 lumen) and also take care that they are protected from the weather. This alone can cost up to 3000$ USD. However this will be cheaper for smaller surfaces.</p>
<p>Also light conditions will have to be taken into account so street lights may need to be turned off. The darker the environment the better or the real shape of the building will be visible and take away from the illusion one is trying to create.</p>

Our visuals group Obscura was asked by Danish band TV-2 to create a visual backdrop for their new tour. TV-2 is a household name here in Denmark, they have been in the studio and on the roads for 30 years now. But whereas the music and lyrics are distinct and catchy they never had a very clear visual universe. Luckily for us the band were very open for ideas and while brainstorming together we came upon this idea: One long video (75 minutes) through the whole show, without using any cuts but instead letting each element slowly appear on the screen in one continuous movement. The idea of the video was to start at the invention of moving images around the 1880s and move forward in time through a collage [&#8230;]]]></description>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sliider is a simple yet usable application I&#8217;ve created for VJing with webGL and other interactive web based graphics. It works on Mac OSX, Windows and Linux. I am releasing an early preview version that has these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded Chrome browser. 99% of what works in Chrome will work in Sliider.</li>
<li>full screen output</li>
<li>A <-> B crossfader</li>
<li>Load html files from disk or the web</li>
<li>Syphon output for the OSX version</li>
<li>Control panel with sliders and buttons</li>
<li>Drag and click in the scene with the mouse</li>
</ul>
<p>Download <a href="http://www.udart.dk/2013/11/01/download-sliider-preview-version/" >Sliider preview version</a></p>
<p>Find below a video where I demonstrate Sliider</p>
<h2>What is Sliider</h2>
<p>Sliider is basically a Chrome browser with some added features that makes it more suited for live performance. You can create your own html pages with any graphics you like whether it is based on WebGl, canvas or SVG and Sliider will display it. Even pages with Flash content should work. By adding a few lines of code to your page javascript (see slii.inputs), you can have custom buttons and sliders in the control window of Sliider.</p>
<h2>For developers</h2>
<p>Sliider is open source so everything from my examples to the application itself is open for you to use or modify. The Sliider Windows version, and the Sliider fullscreen OSX version are based on <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit"  target="_blank">Node-Webkit</a>. Get the <a href="https://github.com/vibber/Sliider"  target="_blank">source code of Sliider</a> on Github. The Sliider Syphon version for OSX is based on the Chromium embedded framework and the source code is here: <a href="https://github.com/vibber/CefWithSyphon"  target="_blank">CefWithSyphon on Github</a></p>
<h2>Important note</h2>
<p>Only use Sliider for trusted content. Sliider does not have the security that normally protect you when you browse the web. So don&#8217;t use Sliider for browsing cat movie sites please&#8230;</p>
<h2>Get in touch with me</h2>
<p>Please do get in touch if you&#8217;ve created something fun. Get in touch on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/udart"  target="_blank">Udart Facebook page</a> or submit bugs on the <a href="https://github.com/vibber/Sliider"  target="_blank">Github Sliider page</a>.</p>
