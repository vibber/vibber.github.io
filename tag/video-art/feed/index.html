		<description><![CDATA[That&#8217;s what I call my current visual explorations. There&#8217;s something endlessly fascinating to me in these 3D humanoid characters and their movements so I will definitely continue to explore this theme through animations, VJ performances etc. Here&#8217;s a few animated GIFs (I hope they play in your browser) plus a video from a recent performance in Copenhagen as a part of Obscura &#8211; the group of people I&#8217;m working with. Live music performance by ir (aka. Jonas Olesen), visuals by Udart. Copenhagen 2012]]></description>

Actually I was mostly on another project at the time but I followed with great interest the work that my colleagues Frederik and Kasper did here. For all of us this installation was a learning experience in using Unity 3D for mapping onto a spherical object.

They ended up with these little creatures created in Open Frameworks which were piped into Unity 3D via Syphon. They then made a Unity app for mapping onto the sphere. A regular 3D mapped rendering would not do here, as the small boids react to the presence of people in the room via a motion tracking camera.<br />
Using Unity went resonably well &#8211; it has a bit of a learning curve, but it definitely has potential for installations that combine live interactivity with mapping, although they ran into some issues that stem from the fact that this is created as a game engine and not a mapping tool.<br />
We feel that we have only just scratched the surface here. In tandem with Syphon you could use Unity to map all sorts of live input onto complex shapes. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[My current project is an experimantal short film. I had the idea one day looking at an orchid in the window sill. I have used no post processing tricks just the plant and some visuals beamed onto it with the video projector. The visuals were made with eMotion, Â the QC patch Soundflower and a particle screensaver. I hope to be able post the film soon although my little baby girl keeps pushing my personal deadline for when it should be ready. That&#8217;s okay &#8211; these days I only do projects with a very flexible time frame. [nggallery id=1]]]></description>
