				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have found a way to transfer a live video screen capture from one Mac to another Mac using DV over Firewire.<br />
This might be useful for VJs who want to mix video from two computers without using a capture card &#8211; the 5$ in the title of this post is for buying a Firewire cable.</p>
<p>Have a look at this video tutorial or read on for a text version &#8211; sorry about the less than optimal video and audio quality &#8211; this is my first attempt at doing a tutorial:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="300" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5840999&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5840999&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>First of all you need to download a couple of components which I have collected in a handy zip file: <a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/DV-screen-capture.zip" >DV screen capture components</a></p>
<p>Here are the links for the original sources of the components in the zip file:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=20298"  target="_blank">VirtualDV (in FireWire SDK 26)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/SampleCode/QuartzComposerLiveDV/index.html"  target="_blank">Quartz Composer Live DV</a></li>
<li><a href="http://002.vade.info/?page_id=4"  target="_blank">v002 Screen Capture</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware that as I have not created the software I have no way of making changes or helping out if this hack does not work for you.</p>
<p>1. Connect the two Macs with a Firewire cable.</p>
<p>2. Download the software and start up the VirtualDV app on both computers. This is to fool the computers into believing there is a hardware DV device connected</p>
<p><a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-1.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89" title="tutorial 1" src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-1.png" alt="tutorial 1" width="506" height="623" /></a><br />
Step 2</p>
<p>3. Unpack the v002ScreenCapture.plugin.zip file and install the plugin into /Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins</p>
<p>4. Start up QuartzComposerLiveDV on the computer that you want to capture video from.</p>
<p>5. Click apple+o and open one of the files inside the &#8216;screen sizes&#8217; folder &#8211; select a file that matches the area of the screen you want to capture.<br />
<a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-2.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90" title="tutorial 2" src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-2.png" alt="tutorial 2" width="578" height="448" /></a><br />
Step 5</p>
<p>6. Now if you see a live screen capture in the window inside QuartzComposerLiveDV you&#8217;re up and running.<br />
<a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-3.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-91" title="tutorial 3" src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-3.png" alt="tutorial 3" width="577" height="450" /></a><br />
Step 6</p>
<p>7. Check that it works by going to the receiving computer and open Quicktime Player. Open the Recording tab in the Preferences pane of Quicktime to check that a new video source has been created.<br />
<a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-4.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-92" title="tutorial 4" src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-4.png" alt="tutorial 4" /></a><br />
Step 7</p>
<p>Things to note:<br />
&#8211; I have only tested this on Leopard. Let me know if get it working on other versions of Mac OS.<br />
&#8211; There is a visible delay as with other DV sources. This is because DV is a compressed format and so it also takes some CPU resources on both machines<br />
&#8211; No sound is transmitted although sound is a part of the DV codec. I think this i because there is no sound included in the QuartzComposerLiveDV app.<br />
&#8211; It&#8217;s only possible to capture the primary screen due to the way that v002ScreenCapture works.<br />
&#8211; Keep the QuartzComposerLiveDV app visible &#8211; if you go apple+H the DV signal stops.</p>
<p>Other uses:<br />
&#8211; You could also connect a DV camera and record the screen cast if that is of any use to you&#8230;<br />
&#8211; Or you could load up any other Quartz Composer file in QuartzComposerLiveDV and send that instead. (I tried this and not all QC comps work. I am not sure why&#8230;)</p>
