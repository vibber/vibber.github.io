<h2>What is Sliider</h2>
<p>Sliider is basically a Chrome browser with some added features that makes it more suited for live performance. You can create your own html pages with any graphics you like whether it is based on WebGl, canvas or SVG and Sliider will display it. Even pages with Flash content should work. By adding a few lines of code to your page javascript (see slii.inputs), you can have custom buttons and sliders in the control window of Sliider.</p>
<h2>For developers</h2>
<p>Sliider is open source so everything from my examples to the application itself is open for you to use or modify. The Sliider Windows version, and the Sliider fullscreen OSX version are based on <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit"  target="_blank">Node-Webkit</a>. Get the <a href="https://github.com/vibber/Sliider"  target="_blank">source code of Sliider</a> on Github. The Sliider Syphon version for OSX is based on the Chromium embedded framework and the source code is here: <a href="https://github.com/vibber/CefWithSyphon"  target="_blank">CefWithSyphon on Github</a></p>
<h2>Important note</h2>
<p>Only use Sliider for trusted content. Sliider does not have the security that normally protect you when you browse the web. So don&#8217;t use Sliider for browsing cat movie sites please&#8230;</p>
<h2>Get in touch with me</h2>
<p>Please do get in touch if you&#8217;ve created something fun. Get in touch on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/udart"  target="_blank">Udart Facebook page</a> or submit bugs on the <a href="https://github.com/vibber/Sliider"  target="_blank">Github Sliider page</a>.</p>

They ended up with these little creatures created in Open Frameworks which were piped into Unity 3D via Syphon. They then made a Unity app for mapping onto the sphere. A regular 3D mapped rendering would not do here, as the small boids react to the presence of people in the room via a motion tracking camera.<br />
Using Unity went resonably well &#8211; it has a bit of a learning curve, but it definitely has potential for installations that combine live interactivity with mapping, although they ran into some issues that stem from the fact that this is created as a game engine and not a mapping tool.<br />
We feel that we have only just scratched the surface here. In tandem with Syphon you could use Unity to map all sorts of live input onto complex shapes. </p>

<p>I had a hard time finding a headline for this post. The thing is that something is happening in the VJ/visuals world that is getting me very excited. That thing is a new technology on the Mac called <a target="_blank" href="http://syphon.v002.info/" >Syphon</a>. At this point I think only a small circle of programmers and techies are aware of Syphon as it hasn&#8217;t yet been released. I think it&#8217;s going to have a tremendous impact on the way realtime visual apps (think VDMX, Modul8, Resolume) and visual programming environments are going to work in the future. Let me try to explain.</p>
<p><em>Update: As of today November 3rd, there is a  <a target="_blank" href="http://syphon.v002.info/" >public beta</a> for download for Quartz, FreeFrame, Unity 3D and Jitter.</em></p>
<p>Today each visual app or VJ app is like a closed cage. You create your graphics and it is then sent to your monitor, your video projector or whereever. The output of the app is locked. It cannot be altered after it leaves the app.<br />
Imagine you had two apps each producing a live image. Up until now there has been no good way to combine the outputs of those two apps into one image in real time. Like if you created a background in Resolume and a nice particle effect in Modul8. You would have to save one of them as a file and then import the movie into the other app. Or you would have to use a screen grabber to catch the image from Resolume and put it into Modul8 in real time, but that uses a lot of the ressources of your computer and tends to slow down the other apps if you are not careful.</p>
<p>So in reality most people working with real time visuals just get used to preproducing clips and importing them into their favourite VJ app. And in general you just have one visual app open when you perform live. But why should it be like this? Why can&#8217;t you e.g. have one specialized app for producing a nice 3D background and bring that into your favourite VJ app to play with? Or why can&#8217;t you bring the output from your VJ app into another specialized app that puts some final touches onto the image before sending it to the screen?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://syphon.v002.info/" >Syphon</a> seems to bring the answer for this. It is a sort of bridging technology &#8211; Mac only &#8211; that allows applications to &#8216;talk to each other&#8217; and exchange graphics in real time without any delay or loss of image quality. It only works internally in one machine at this point (I think &#8211; Syphon people correct me if I&#8217;m wrong) but it still brings a lot of potential for those who perform with visuals live.</p>
<p>One example of this is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.modul8.us/?p=474" >MadMapper</a> software. This is currently also in development and has not been released yet. This software allows you to use the output of any Syphon capable app as material for a <a href="http://www.udart.dk/2010/02/17/projection-mapping-on-the-rise/" >mapping installation</a>. The MadMapper allows you to split up the image into areas that can be projected onto an object. In this way you can produce your images live in another app of your choice and then let MadMapper handle the final alignment of the image onto the object.</p>
<p>I hope you can share my excitement here. This is just one example of why we should &#8216;open up the cage&#8217; and set the visuals free. If Syphon catches on I think everybody is gong to benefit from this ability to exchange visuals between applications. My bet is that we will see more specialized applications for live visuals instead of giant VJ apps that try to include every possible feature. This is a good thing in my opinion as I think the overall quality and the number of options available will benefit from this.</p>
