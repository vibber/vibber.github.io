		<description><![CDATA[UDART -- very interested in this solution but having an issue, perhaps I misunderstand what you are accomplishing.

My goal is to have a Quartz Composer Syphon server push images to a web browser embedded Syphon client. Then I will separately control the QC Syphon server with Kineme Network HTTP Javascript from the browser. Have you ever seen this done?

You say you prepped a Syphon server as a QT Mov then embed it in the page as &quot;Syphon%20Client%QC.mov&quot; -- umm, are you embedding the Syphon client or the Syphon server?

I AM able to embed the Syphon Server QC as a Quicktime MOV in Chrome &amp; Safari and display the imagery in the browser. But I am NOT able to get a QC Syphon client to recognize the embedded Syphon server or get images from it. And actually, I want the reverse -- a Web browser embedded Syphon client that&#039;s receiving images from a running QC Syphon server.

Any suggestions?

Much appreciated

		<description><![CDATA[Hey

I&#039;ve developed a software to manipulate the midi data which is coming from a controller, so that I can use midi controllers with &quot;NoteOn, NoteOff&quot; buttons and special controls in Modul8.

So in my software I create a new VirtualMidiEndpoint (it looks like a normal midi device) and map this virtual endpoint to Modul8. The real device is disabled  in Modul8.

Now everything works fine except of your two way midi module, because it doesn&#039;t show my virtual endpoint. Even if I disable the real device in the preferences of Modul8, it is shown in your application.

Would it be possible to fix this and just show the Midi devices which are enabled in Modul8 and also the virtual midi devices?

Sorry for my english!

Kindly regards
Florian]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Kevin,

Sorry for late reaction, wasn&#039;t following this thread for a while.

Toggle is a latch function, to handle controller with piano keys. They usually sen MIDI ON and then immediately OFF, so you M8 button with jump back to original value. Select it if you experience this problem

Feedback: when selected, will work as original UDART version and send MIDI back to you device. I use it with TouchOSC on IPad, to sync controls on IPad with Module8 values.
When deselected, it will NOT send MIDI feedback, but will prevent jumping sliders for controllers they don&#039;t read MIDI feedback.

New save/load function will allow you to save the settings in a file, so you could easy switch between presets.

There are also few improvements to the original code and I&#039;m happy it works for you!
Cheers,
Vladimir]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Udart
I just discovered your recently built (Raylab) Hybrid Two Way Midi Out on the Modules Library. It works well with my BCR2000. With the &quot;regular Two Way Midi Out&quot; i wasnt succesful!
Thanks a lot!
What about the TOGGLE &amp; FEEDBACK switches? What do they do? 
Best

		<description><![CDATA[Just shared a modified version of this module in public library, see (ray lab) Hybrid Two Way MIDI (UDART).
Added:
1. Extensions to handle devices or controls that do not support MIDI feedback: module will lock the incoming values until they match the current value of Modul8 control (sliders en knobs), so they wan&#039;t jump when switching between layers. Use &#039;feedback&#039; checkbox to choose. If checked, feedback is sent to control (original behaviour). If unchecked, module will lock the incoming value until match. 
2. Togggle option for buttons (very useful)
3. Save/Load current midi map to/from file. Loading simply overwrites the current map.

This is beta, please test before using in production!]]></description>
