<h2>Quick start</h2>
<ul>
<li>Download the &#8216;Examples&#8217; package and the Sliider app for your platform. </li>
<li>Click the left most &#8216;Open&#8217; button in the control window</li>
<li>Click &#8216;Open file&#8217;</li>
<li>Locate the index.html in one of the Examples folders and click OK</li>
</ul>
<h2>For Linux users</h2>
<p>There is no prepackaged version for Linux and I have not tested on Linux. You should be able to run Sliider by downloading <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit"  target="_blank">Node-Webkit</a> for Linux and the <a href="https://github.com/vibber/Sliider"  target="_blank">Sliider source</a>. Drop the Sliider source folder on the Node-Webkit application and it should work.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A remix could be many things but in this case the word refers to some modifications I made to the maps at <a href="http://here.com"  target="_blank">here.com</a> in realtime using the <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki"  target="_blank">Node-Webkit</a> framework. Like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/Maps_before_after.png" ><img src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/Maps_before_after.png" alt="Maps_before_after" title="Maps_before_after" width="540" height="181" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-334" /></a></p>
<p>What you see on the right is a screen-shot of the live and navigable application at here.com but interface elements have been removed and the whole maps has received a colored tint.</p>
<p>In other words it&#8217;s possible to modify and change the look and functionality of a live website without copying it to another server or hack the server on which the website resides (don&#8217;t do that, kids!).<br />
I made the modifications using simple html and javascript which modifies the website when viewed in my own browser &#8211; or in this case a specialized application made using the <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki"  target="_blank">Node-Webkit</a> framework. </p>
<p>In this video I demonstrate how the modification works:<br />
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/66271461" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>As a part of my work with Obscura we do visuals for various events. For this one event it would be really appropriate to display some nice slow flyover video on the big screen of 3d maps like the ones you have on Apple maps or Google maps on iOS. I found the maps at here.com and pondered how to get them on the big screen without those navigation buttons while still being able to control camera movements.</p>
<h2>Real time browser remix</h2>
<p>Via javascript it&#8217;s pretty easy to modify the DOM of a web page &#8211; thus controlling how the page is displayed in your browser. and hiding an element or a section only requires one line of code. For instance you can navigate to here.com in the Chrome or Firefox browser, choose the 3D map display and bring up the Developer Tools console. There you enter this line:</p>
<p><code>window.document.getElementById("map-controls").style.display = "none";</code></p>
<p>And voila the navigation button are gone and same goes for the other UI overlays.<br />
Changing the look of the map was easy with CSS filters that have become available in HTML5.</p>
<p>So using the developer tools I also figured out a bit of the code that lies below the surface on here.com and I found some methods that I could trigger and use to navigate the map even with no visible controls. Keyboard shortcuts are already implemented (arrows, shift, + and -) but I didn&#8217;t like the movements &#8211; I thought it was going to fast on a big screen.</p>
<h2>Security Issues</h2>
<p>Problem is I would have to put all this stuff in to the console every time I open the here.com website. And with an accidental reload of the page I would have to do it again.<br />
So I thought about writing a document that opens here.com in a pop up window and then modifies it in the same way as we did above? Well this is called cross site scripting and there are many reasons why browser creators don&#8217;t like that.</p>
<h2>Node-Webkit</h2>
<p>However from other experiments I have become familiar with an application framework called <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki"  target="_blank">Node-Webkit</a> which provides a handy and quite easy way to create standalone applications using HTML and Javascript. And since node-webkit has a fully functional Chromium (open sourced Chrome) browser embedded I could continue my experiments in Node-webkit. And most importantly &#8211; without any security restrictions. Node-webkit allows you to dig into the DOM and javascript of any webpage you load!</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Here is the final Node-webkit application I made. To run it simply go to Node-webkit site and grab <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit#downloads"  target="_blank">a binary</a> for your platform then download my file and open it with node-webkit: <a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/maps.nw" >Maps</a><br />
My small app has plenty of bugs (I had one day before the event to figure it out) but feel free to have a look. Simply rename maps.nw to .zip and unpack it.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>What does &#8216;Two Way MIDI&#8217; do?</strong></p>

<p style="font: normal normal normal 16px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px;"><strong>Who can use this module?</strong></p>
<p>This module is only relevant if you have a midi device that is designed to <em>receive</em> MIDI as well as send MIDI. Typically these devices will have motorized faders or 360 degree (endless) knobs with LED displays. Examples of such are Novation MIDI controllers and Behringer BCF2000.</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;">
<p><iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/17095561?byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=ffffff" width="500" height="313" frameborder="0"></iframe><a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/17095561" >Modul8 &#8211; introduction to the &#8216;Two Way Midi&#8217; module</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/user702278" >Udart (Vibeke Bertelsen)</a> on <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com" >Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>How do I get started with this module?</strong></p>
<p>Before you start please clear your current midi map. This is not a must but it is recommended to avoid unexpected results when trying out the module. You can save your current midi map by selecting Mapping -&gt; Import/Export -&gt; Export MIDI map. Then remove the map by selecting Mapping -&gt; Edit MIDI map -&gt; Clear map. Please do this for &#8216;Focus&#8217; as well as &#8216;Position&#8217; and &#8216;Layerset + Position&#8217; modes.</p>
<p>1. When you first start the module you&#8217;ll see a list called &#8216;MIDI Device&#8217;. Please start by selecting your MIDI device from the list. The module should now be able to communicate with your midi device.</p>
<p>2. Try turning a knob on your midi device. You should see some text appear at the very bottom of the module window. Eg. &#8216;receive: ch1 cc3 127&#8242;. This is information about the midi your device is sending to the module.</p>
<p>3. Now try mapping something. Click Edit, click something in the Modul8 interface. If a text appears in the &#8216;action&#8217; field (e.g. &#8216;ctrl_layer_alpha&#8217;) you can map it to your midi device. Simply turn a knob and it is mapped.</p>
<p>4. Click another Modul8 control or map multiple MIDI knobs to the same Modul8 control if you wish</p>
<p>5. Click &#8216;end edit&#8217; when you are done mapping. You should now be able to control Modul8 with your mapped knobs. Also if you change the Modul8 control the change should be reflected on the MIDI device</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 24.0px Helvetica;"><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Will this module work with my device?</strong></p>
<p>The module is currently in beta and has only been tested with the Novation Nocturn and the Behringer BCF2000 MIDI controllers. It is designed to work for all devices that are able to receive MIDI, so it needs to be tested. Please get in touch if you have tested it with other devices<span style="font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica; min-height: 19.0px;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>What version of Modul8 do I need to use this module?</strong></p>
<p>So far this module has only been tested with Modul8 v2.6 but it may work with older versions. Please get in touch if you have tested the module with an older version of Modul8.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica; min-height: 19.0px;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>What MIDI values are sent for the different Modul8 controls?</strong></p>
<p>0-127 for all scalers and sliders and knobs.</p>
<p>For layerset buttons 0-7 is sent.</p>
<p>For Media set pages 0-7 is sent. (8 for the &#8216;sp&#8217; page)</p>
<p>And so on 0,1,2,3…. for all special elements like radio buttons etc.</p>
<p>You can see what midi values are being sent out from Modul8 by touching a Modul8 control (one that has been mapped). Look at the very bottom of the module window. A message will appear e.g. &#8216;send: ch2 cc34 127&#8242;. The last number is the midi value. &#8216;ch&#8217; is channel and the next is &#8216;cc&#8217; for control change or &#8216;n&#8217; for note.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>How do I set up a button on my MIDI device to select layer sets in Modul8?</strong></p>
<p>Look for a setting on your MIDI device to create a &#8216;Step&#8217; button. So that first time you press the button it sends 0, next tme 1 etc. with a max value of 7.</p>
<p>You can also set a rotary knob with a minimum of 0 and a max limit of 7.</p>
<p>If this is not possible with your device it is possible to use the regular Modul8 midi mapping (the Mapping menu in Modul8). See <span style="font: 8.0px Helvetica;">&#8216;</span>Can I use this module together with the regular MIDI mapping in Modul8&#8242;.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>How do I set up a button on my MIDI device to select media sets in Modul8?</strong></p>
<p>See above. Same method as when mapping layer sets.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Does this module work with all controls in Modul8?</strong></p>
<p>No, there are some major limitations unfortunately. First of all &#8216;Two Way MIDI&#8217; is not able to work with any of the controls in any of the other modules. Secondly there are also a few features in the main Modul8 interface that does not work with &#8216;Two Way MIDI&#8217; (e.g. create/duplicate/delete layer).</p>
<p>However there is a workaround. You can use the regular MIDI mapping in Modul8 together with the module to overcome some of these limitations (your only challenge is to keep track of what you have mapped where).</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>What is the difference between this module and the regular MIDI mapping in Modul8?</strong></p>
<p>&#8211; Module sends and receves midi. Buiit in mapping only receives</p>
<p>&#8211; Built in mapping has &#8216;focus&#8217;, &#8216;position&#8217; and &#8216;layerset + position&#8217; modes. Module only has &#8216;focus&#8217; and &#8216;position&#8217; mode.</p>
<p>&#8211; This module treats layer set buttons, media set buttons and other radio buttons as groups instead of separate buttons. E.g. you can map one rotary knob or button to flip through layer sets.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Can I use this module together with the regular MIDI mapping in Modul8?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it is possible to use this module and the built in MIDI mapping (the mapping menu). The same control can even be mapped in the built in MIDI mapping and in the module at the same time &#8211; but I don&#8217;t recommend this &#8211; I recommend only using the built in MIDI mapping for controls that are not covered by this module.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>What are the &#8216;focus&#8217; and &#8216;position&#8217; buttons for?</strong></p>
<p>These are buttons for switching between two modes of midi mapping. They are identical to the &#8216;focus&#8217; and &#8216;position&#8217; mode of the regular MIDI mapping in Modul8.</p>
<p>In &#8216;focus&#8217; mode you map the dial to the active layer in Modul8. E.g. you map a dial to the movie speed in &#8216;focus&#8217; mode. If you go to another layer your dial will change the speed of the selected layer.</p>
<p>In &#8216;position&#8217; mode you map to a specific layer. E.g. the movie speed of layer 3. If you change focus to any other layer your dial will still control the speed of layer 3.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Why is there no &#8216;layerset + position&#8217; mode?</strong></p>
<p>The regular Midi mapping in Modul8 has &#8216;focus&#8217;, &#8216;position&#8217; and &#8216;layerset + position&#8217; mapping modes. This module only has the &#8216;focus&#8217; and &#8216;position&#8217; modes. I have made this decision as I see no advantage of building this into the module. If you need this mode just use the regular midi mapping for this.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Are my MIDI mappings kept next time I start Modul8?</strong></p>
<p>The module has two options for where to save your MIDI mapping &#8216;Default&#8217; and &#8216;Project&#8217;. When you make a mapping in &#8216;Default&#8217; mode the MIDI mapping will be kept inside Modul8 and be active next time you start Modul8. If you select &#8216;Project&#8217; mode and make a MIDI mapping the mapping will be kept inside the your Project file and so the MIDI mapping will be active next time you open that project.</p>
<p>Please be aware that if you edit the module code in the Module editor, you will loose any &#8216;Default&#8217; map you might have.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Can I have a different MIDI mapping for each project?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Just choose &#8216;Project&#8217; mode before you make the mapping.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Can I export my MIDI mapping?</strong></p>
<p>Not directly no. You can however reuse your mapping with a small workaround. E.g. if you want to use your MIDI mapping from project A in Project B: Open project A. Project A will be in &#8216;project mode&#8217; if it has it&#8217;s own MIDI mapping. Click &#8216;copy to default&#8217;. Next open Project B, make sure the module is in &#8216;default&#8217; mode then click &#8216;copy to project&#8217;.</p>
<p>Also if you wish to back up your default mapping you can create a new blank Modul8 project and click &#8216;copy to project&#8217;. Your default mapping will now be saved inside the project file. You can recover your mapping at a later date if you need it by opening the project and clicking &#8216;copy to default&#8217;.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>What happens if I have made a default MIDI mapping and then open a project that has it&#8217;s own mapping?</strong></p>
<p>This is not a problem you can freely switch between your default and your project mapping. Just be aware if you are in default or project mode before clicking &#8216;edit&#8217; and making additional mappings.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 16.0px Helvetica;"><strong>Can I use multiple MIDI controllers?</strong></p>
<p>The module is only designed to be used with one MIDI device at a time. There may be workarounds to using multiple controllers but this has not been tested.</p>

One of the nice things about Modul8 is, that people with a bit of programming skills are able to augment the application by adding so called modules. I have just made my first module &#8211; it is available for download and is called &#8216;Crop layer (Udart)&#8217;. It&#8217;s a simple module to make it possible to crop the picture in each layer. Look out for more modules to come (I hope)]]></description>
