				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing that takes up my spare time right now: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL"  target="_blank">WebGL</a>. For me with my web developer background (PHP, javascript, .NET) and my growing interest in realtime 3D graphics it&#8217;s so obvious that I can&#8217;t believe I haven&#8217;t played around with it before. The good thing is that at this point there are plenty of resources for those who want to learn and that it has been implemented in a stable way in some major browsers.<br />
The downside is that it&#8217;s not an obvious choice for VJs as it does not integrate with VJ apps. But I&#8217;m sure tools will appear over time to overcome this.</p>
<p>Just have a look at some of the mind-blowing visual possibilities WebGL brings for visualists:<br />
<a href="http://thenextweb.com/shareables/2011/11/26/lights-an-amazing-display-of-webgl-power-kiss-your-flash-goodbye/"  target="_blank">Lights</a><br />
<a href="http://www.ro.me/tech/"  target="_blank">Ro.me</a><br />
<a href="http://www.webgl.com/2012/10/webgl-demo-blast/"  target="_blank">Blast</a><br />
Often when delving into a new programming environment the hard part comes right at the beginning when you try to get a grasp of the architecture of things and the tools needed. I have been playing around with webGL for about a week now and I am slowly getting over that first stony hillside I needed to climb before being able to code anything useful.</p>
<p>So I thought I&#8217;d share what I found useful along the way in order to get up and running.</p>
<h3>1. Programming environment</h3>
<p>In theory all you need is a text editor and a browser. But I know from experience that a real code editor is useful to help keep everything readable. So far I am quite pleased with <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/"  target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>. As for the browser I chose <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/da/chrome/browser/"  target="_blank">Chrome</a> for development, but it could probably just as well be <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"  target="_blank">Firefox</a>. From what I&#8217;ve heard Opera and Safari do not quite live up to the others yet and as for Internet Explorer &#8211; <a href="http://talk.webplatform.org/forums/index.php/506/when-will-internet-explorer-support-webgl"  target="_blank">who knows?</a>. Make sure to have the latest version of the browser.</p>
<h3>2. Web server</h3>
<p>Yes a web server is needed, loading up pages by simply opening them locally is only going to work for the simplest of coding examples. Fortunately I am  on a Mac and got a long way using the built in Python http-server. Here&#8217;s a quick how-to:<br />
Open the Terminal app, write &#8216;cd &#8216; and drag the folder with your code files into the Terminal window. Now it says &#8216;cd /Users/You/Path/To/Your/Folder/&#8217;. Make sure there&#8217;s a space after cd. Enter. Then write &#8216;python -mSimpleHTTPServer&#8217;. Enter. Now the Terminal should respond &#8216;Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000&#8242;. Go into Chrome and write &#8216;http://localhost:8000&#8242; as the address. You should now see the contents of your folder as clickable links.</p>
<h3>3. WebGL API</h3>
<p>webGL is supported by the above mentioned browsers out of the box. However I use an API for accessing webGL as I find the objects and functions of the API hide some of the complexities and provide me with helpful shortcuts to get things done. One of the most popular at the moment seems to be <a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/"   target="_blank">Three.js</a> and so far I am enjoying using it a lot. There are a lot of good resources and examples on Three.js on the net right now.</p>
<h3>4. Getting started with three.js</h3>
<p>First I followed <a href="http://www.aerotwist.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-three-js/"   target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. Then I tried to code something myself. I found out that the <a href="http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/docs/"  target="_blank">documentation</a> is of some use but it&#8217;s very incomplete at the moment. So I did what was recommended and dug into the three.js examples (they are in the examples folder of the three.js download). I start out by looking at an example that does something close to what I want to achieve and then I copy the file and start messing with the code. Unfortunately I have often found the examples to be overly complex &#8211; especially when I started out &#8211; things are starting to make more sense now. I keep peeling away the stuff that I don&#8217;t need in the code, while continually checking in the browser what effect my change is having until I have a minimal working example. Then and only then do I start adding my own code. I may also try to combine code from different examples to achieve what I want.</p>
<h3>5. Debugging javascript</h3>
<p>WebGL is all about javascript and fortunately Chromes developer tools are really good for telling what&#8217;s going on and what is going wrong. cmd+option+I brings up the panel. Console shows the error messages but I have also had good use of the Watch Expressions and the Break Points. Here&#8217;s a good article to get started with the <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/tutorials/javascript-debugging-beginners"  target="_blank">debugger tools</a>.</p>
<h3>6. Figuring out the error messages</h3>
<p>For many things I understand what&#8217;s wrong by simply clicking the link in the console and see where in the code the error is. But for the more cryptic error messages Google is my friend. It may seem obvious but simply googling &#8216;webGL three.js&#8217; + the error message will often bring up something useful. Especially the questions and answers on stackoverflow.com &#8211; no wonder as the developer of three.js moved all support to this site. For some browser specific errors searching for &#8216;chrome&#8217; + error text will bring up an answer.</p>
<h3>7. What WebGL isn&#8217;t</h3>
<p>First of all WebGL builds upon OpenGL but it&#8217;s not the same. So reading up OpenGL won&#8217;t be directly applicable &#8211; especially so if you&#8217;re using an API like three.js. OpenGL code examples from other contexts may be portable but not without some translation. If you&#8217;re new to the whole realm of realtime 3D graphics including openGL it would probably be useful to read a primer on the general concepts &#8211; although one big advantage of three.js lies in the way it uses words and concepts that will be familiar to you if you have played with 3D applications such as 3D Studio, Maya or Cinema4D.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s it from me for now. I don&#8217;t offer a complete webGL tutorial just these few tips for now. If you are already up and running with WebGL feel free to add in the comments any other similar tips that helped you when you started out.</p>

<p>You try it out in demo mode (and click away a dialog box every twenty minutes). It&#8217;s an independent app so apart from Modul8 it ought to work with any VJ app that supports midi clock.</p>
<p>1. First you go to the Waveclock preferences and select your microphone or line-in for the input. And some midi channel for the output &#8211; IAC Driver for instance. </p>
<p>2. Then in Modul8 or your other VJ app you go to preferences and confirm that IAC Driver is activated as a midi input.</p>
<p>3. Then (in Modul8) you activate the BPM modul and click &#8216;use midi clock&#8217;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days as a part of the Obscura crew I am ofting doing visual shows that have more in common with theatre productions than traditional VJing. Often there is some sort of script for a show or a piece of music that is rehearsed. For these types of jobs I have found good use for the application called <a target="_blank" href="http://figure53.com/qlab/" >QLab</a> which is great for triggering a pre planned sequence of events.</p>
<p>Actually the whole point of QLab is to line up a sequence of audio, video files or other types of events and being able to trigger them with a simple &#8216;Go&#8217; button at the exact right time during the show.<br />
QLab was originally developed with audio in mind and has later been extended with video features so it does not have many features as VJ applications when it comes to live manipulations of images and video. But for those of us who sometimes wish for a timeline in our favorite VJ application, QLab may be an option if you set it up to run alongside your VJ app.<br />
For our shows we typically use Modul8 and I found two ways to achieve this.</p>
<p>1. Capturing the video output of QLab and using it as input in Modul8. This is done with two computers &#8211; one with a video capture card such as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.blackmagic-design.com/products/intensity/" >Blackmagic Intensity</a> hardware or the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.matrox.com/video/en/products/pc/mxo2_family/mxo2_mini/" >Matrox MXO2 mini</a> and the other computer running QLab. With this method you run some images or videos using QLab and you are then able to manipulate them live in Modul8 as you would do with any other source.</p>
<p>2. Setting up QLab to send midi and mapping the buttons in Modul8 so that they respond to the midi commands. This can be done using one computer running both apps or using two computers and a midi connection between them. In this scenario QLab is merely the &#8216;conductor&#8217; telling Modul8 what to do. Modul8 holds all the images or videos used.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/qlab-setup.png" ><img src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/qlab-setup.png" alt="qlab setup" title="qlab setup" width="540" height="363" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-286" /></a></p>
<p>The advantage of these two methods is that you have some way of combining improvised VJing with a sequence of planned cues. For instance &#8211; as we did recently you can use the first method to trigger a series of slides containing the lyrics of a song and then use Modul8 to distort and manipulate them. Furthermore as this setup involves two computers two people are able to share this task &#8211; one person triggering the lyrics at the right time and one person adding effects. This could be done using any VJ application that is compatible with the video capture card not just Modul8.</p>

You might think that creating an alias of the media would work, but Modul8 doesn&#8217;t import aliases. I found another solution in the Terminal command for creating &#8216;hard links&#8217;.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All users of Modul8 encounter the problem of keeping track of files in their projects I suppose. Sometimes you want to reuse media in new projects without creating extra copies of them and thereby cluttering your hard drive. Still you want the media collected in the same folder as the project in order to not break anything if you rename or move the original. You might think that creating an alias of the media would work, but Modul8 doesn&#8217;t import aliases.</p>
<p>I found another solution in the Terminal command for creating &#8216;hard links&#8217;. A hard link works a bit like an alias except it appears to be an actual file and it works in Modul8. In reality there is only one copy of the movie taking up space. And even if you rename, move or delete the original file the new file will continue to work.<br />
EDIT: One caveat I found is that if you use Time Machine and need to restore from a backup your hard links will be gone. This is the same for a number of backup applications.</p>
<p>What you do is this:</p>
<ol> 1. Start up the Terminal app<br />
2. Write the command ln followed by the full path to the source file followed by the full path to the destination file (the link). Like this: <code>ln /Users/Udart/Movies/originalmovie.mov /Users/Udart/Movies/NewProject/newmovie.mov</code><br />
3. Hit enter and the file is created and looks and acts as a normal movie file.</ol>
<p>Tip: Write ln and then drag the source file in to the terminal window instead of typing. Similarly drag the destination folder to the Terminal and manually type a slash (/) plus the new filename. Remember a space between the command and the file path.</p>

However there are a number of problems with this approach: No 1. Performance. I have done tests and often there is a severe drop in framerate for qtz files in Modul8 compared to the framerate in the Quartz Composer editor. No 2. You cannot decide the rendering size of .qtz files in Modul8 (in version 2.5). They are always rendered as 640&#215;480. In Modul8 v2.6 you can set the size in Preferences but there may be many situations where you&#8217;d like to set the size for the individual files. No 3. You cannot set the duration of .qtz files in Modul8. Duration will always be 30 sec.

<p>I find that these problems can be solved by following the steps below and converting the .qtz file to a .mov before importing it into Modul8.</p>
<p>If you have Quicktime Pro (as you should &#8211; it&#8217;s sort of a vj&#8217;s swiss army knife) just</p>
<p>1 &#8211; open your qtz file with Quicktime pro. Then<br />
2 &#8211; resize the viewer window to your desired size. You can hit cmd+I to view the current size in the inspector.<br />
3 &#8211; Save the file as a .mov using &#8216;Save as&#8217; where you have the option to set another duration eg. 60 sec.</p>
<p>Now you can open the mov file in Modul8 and it will have the size and duration you want plus in many cases the framerate will improve. Note that even though the file is called .mov it is still a Quartz composition. It&#8217;s just been wrapped in a Quicktime packaging.</p>
<p>Also note that if the size is too big you won&#8217;t gain better performance even if you scale it down inside Modul8. You&#8217;ll have to scale down the mov file in Quicktime until you find a size that works.</p>
<p>Hope this works for you</p>

<p>Now I know that everybody has their own workflow and preferences when organizing their files but you might find this tip useful if you ever find yourself in situations (like I often do) where you want to create a VJ set from items in your library and you lose track of what you have inside your hierarchy of folders and need a visual way to quickly browse through the whole collection.</p>
<p>This tip is a demonstration of one way to use the software &#8211; Adobe Bridge has other features like filters, search and options for rating and labeling your media (or files of any other type).</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="300" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7012812&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7012812&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Now when using Modul8 I realize it&#8217;s better to always keep your media in the same place as the project file. In the video I drag the media directly into M8. Another and better way may be to create a project folder first then copying the media by dragging them from Bridge into the folder while holding down the alt/option key.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have found a way to transfer a live video screen capture from one Mac to another Mac using DV over Firewire.<br />
This might be useful for VJs who want to mix video from two computers without using a capture card &#8211; the 5$ in the title of this post is for buying a Firewire cable.</p>
<p>Have a look at this video tutorial or read on for a text version &#8211; sorry about the less than optimal video and audio quality &#8211; this is my first attempt at doing a tutorial:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="400" height="300" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="src" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5840999&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="400" height="300" src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=5840999&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>First of all you need to download a couple of components which I have collected in a handy zip file: <a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/DV-screen-capture.zip" >DV screen capture components</a></p>
<p>Here are the links for the original sources of the components in the zip file:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=20298"  target="_blank">VirtualDV (in FireWire SDK 26)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/SampleCode/QuartzComposerLiveDV/index.html"  target="_blank">Quartz Composer Live DV</a></li>
<li><a href="http://002.vade.info/?page_id=4"  target="_blank">v002 Screen Capture</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please be aware that as I have not created the software I have no way of making changes or helping out if this hack does not work for you.</p>
<p>1. Connect the two Macs with a Firewire cable.</p>
<p>2. Download the software and start up the VirtualDV app on both computers. This is to fool the computers into believing there is a hardware DV device connected</p>
<p><a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-1.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-89" title="tutorial 1" src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-1.png" alt="tutorial 1" width="506" height="623" /></a><br />
Step 2</p>
<p>3. Unpack the v002ScreenCapture.plugin.zip file and install the plugin into /Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins</p>
<p>4. Start up QuartzComposerLiveDV on the computer that you want to capture video from.</p>
<p>5. Click apple+o and open one of the files inside the &#8216;screen sizes&#8217; folder &#8211; select a file that matches the area of the screen you want to capture.<br />
<a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-2.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90" title="tutorial 2" src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-2.png" alt="tutorial 2" width="578" height="448" /></a><br />
Step 5</p>
<p>6. Now if you see a live screen capture in the window inside QuartzComposerLiveDV you&#8217;re up and running.<br />
<a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-3.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-91" title="tutorial 3" src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-3.png" alt="tutorial 3" width="577" height="450" /></a><br />
Step 6</p>
<p>7. Check that it works by going to the receiving computer and open Quicktime Player. Open the Recording tab in the Preferences pane of Quicktime to check that a new video source has been created.<br />
<a href="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-4.png" ><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-92" title="tutorial 4" src="http://www.udart.dk/wp-content/tutorial-4.png" alt="tutorial 4" /></a><br />
Step 7</p>
<p>Things to note:<br />
&#8211; I have only tested this on Leopard. Let me know if get it working on other versions of Mac OS.<br />
&#8211; There is a visible delay as with other DV sources. This is because DV is a compressed format and so it also takes some CPU resources on both machines<br />
&#8211; No sound is transmitted although sound is a part of the DV codec. I think this i because there is no sound included in the QuartzComposerLiveDV app.<br />
&#8211; It&#8217;s only possible to capture the primary screen due to the way that v002ScreenCapture works.<br />
&#8211; Keep the QuartzComposerLiveDV app visible &#8211; if you go apple+H the DV signal stops.</p>
<p>Other uses:<br />
&#8211; You could also connect a DV camera and record the screen cast if that is of any use to you&#8230;<br />
&#8211; Or you could load up any other Quartz Composer file in QuartzComposerLiveDV and send that instead. (I tried this and not all QC comps work. I am not sure why&#8230;)</p>
