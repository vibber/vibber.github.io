		<description><![CDATA[&#8220;Valley Of Uncanny #01&#8243; is an interactive animation with music by Zack Christ that explores the relationship between visual and musical rhythms, glitches and distortions. The animation is a part of a series of different virtual sculptures I made of human bodies and faces. Often in games and 3D art the human body is idealized into sexy or heroic archetypes but in this project the two heads are distorted and glitched in ways that create more unfamiliar expressions that sometimes dissolve into pure absctract shapes. The animation is created in WebGL using the popular library Three.js and in order to precisely control the progression of the visuals multiple tracks of keyframes are loaded into the application in order to control animation parameters in sync with the music. The piece is an adaptation of some of the material, that I also use when I perform live as a VJ at concerts. [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p>The piece is an adaptation of some of the material, that I also use when I perform live as a VJ at concerts. I developed a custom VJ application (Sliider) where the same WebGL code is loaded without preprogrammed keyframes. Instead the VJ application allows all parameters to be controlled via midi or OSC.</p>

Doing the mapping was trivial using these tools &#8211; it was the acrylic material itself that proved to be a bit of a challenge. The light projection properties of the material were terrific, a clear and bright image from all angles.

They ended up with these little creatures created in Open Frameworks which were piped into Unity 3D via Syphon. They then made a Unity app for mapping onto the sphere. A regular 3D mapped rendering would not do here, as the small boids react to the presence of people in the room via a motion tracking camera.<br />
Using Unity went resonably well &#8211; it has a bit of a learning curve, but it definitely has potential for installations that combine live interactivity with mapping, although they ran into some issues that stem from the fact that this is created as a game engine and not a mapping tool.<br />
We feel that we have only just scratched the surface here. In tandem with Syphon you could use Unity to map all sorts of live input onto complex shapes. </p>

		<description><![CDATA[For the past two months my work day has been dedicated to a project that I am very proud of. Our visuals group Obscura was asked by Danish band TV-2 to create a visual backdrop for their new tour. TV-2 is a household name here in Denmark, they have been in the studio and on the roads for 30 years now. But whereas the music and lyrics are distinct and catchy they never had a very clear visual universe. Luckily for us the band were very open for ideas and while brainstorming together we came upon this idea: One long video (75 minutes) through the whole show, without using any cuts but instead letting each element slowly appear on the screen in one continuous movement. The idea of the video was to start at the invention of moving images around the 1880s and move forward in time through a collage [&#8230;]]]></description>

<p>Here you&#8217;ll see a short edit of some of the scenes (with another musical score). I recommend going full screen.</p>

Obscura does large scale visual installations for events be it concerts, award shows, parties of different kinds and hopefully there will also in the future be room for a few self financed experimental projects.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s two of our recent jobs</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/15293814" >Giant visuals at The Royal Library</a></p>
<p>Actually although Obscura has lead a quiet existence when it comes to exposure on the web, Frederik has been working under this name solo for quite a few years dating right back to 1998 when he started out making installations using slide projectors. Today he&#8217;s still the anchor person of Obscura with his attention to detail and dedication to inventive solutions involving many pieces of specialized gear.</p>
<p>Obscura doesn&#8217;t have an active blog at the moment so until further notice I&#8217;ll continue to post here on Udart. Also there&#8217;s an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Obscura/159076067443330" >Obscura Facebook page</a> (in Danish).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Recently I have had the pleasure of working with Linda Edsjö a classically trained percussionist and composer Simon Christensen in developing visuals for a piece of modern compositional music. The project was unusual for me as we decided to try to connect the visuals computer with the computer that was running the musical backing track. That way it was possible to obtain a perfect sync Â between music and image. The music was composed as a piece in the Max/MSP software and this was linked to Modul8 (the visuals) through midi. The music software was sending midi on every beat and another midi signal whenever the music entered a new section of the piece. To achieve the result I wanted I had to program two small modules for Modul8. These modules were in charge of turning layers on and off, applying effects and switching between images.

The project was unusual for me as we decided to try to connect the visuals computer with the computer that was running the musical backing track. That way it was possible to obtain a perfect sync Â between music and image.</p>
