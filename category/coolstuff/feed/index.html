<p>Sliider is a simple yet usable application I&#8217;ve created for VJing with webGL and other interactive web based graphics. It works on Mac OSX, Windows and Linux. I am releasing an early preview version that has these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embedded Chrome browser. 99% of what works in Chrome will work in Sliider.</li>
<li>full screen output</li>
<li>A <-> B crossfader</li>
<li>Load html files from disk or the web</li>
<li>Syphon output for the OSX version</li>
<li>Control panel with sliders and buttons</li>
<li>Drag and click in the scene with the mouse</li>
</ul>
<p>Download <a href="http://www.udart.dk/2013/11/01/download-sliider-preview-version/" >Sliider preview version</a></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video where I demonstrate Sliider</p>
<p><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/78330901" width="540" height="303" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/78330901" >Sliider &#8211; Demonstration</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/udart" >Udart (Vibeke Bertelsen)</a> on <a target="_blank" href="https://vimeo.com" >Vimeo</a>.</p>
<h2>What is Sliider</h2>
<p>Sliider is basically a Chrome browser with some added features that makes it more suited for live performance. You can create your own html pages with any graphics you like whether it is based on WebGl, canvas or SVG and Sliider will display it. Even pages with Flash content should work. By adding a few lines of code to your page javascript (see slii.inputs), you can have custom buttons and sliders in the control window of Sliider.</p>
<h2>For developers</h2>
<p>Sliider is open source so everything from my examples to the application itself is open for you to use or modify. The Sliider Windows version, and the Sliider fullscreen OSX version are based on <a href="https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit"  target="_blank">Node-Webkit</a>. Get the <a href="https://github.com/vibber/Sliider"  target="_blank">source code of Sliider</a> on Github. The Sliider Syphon version for OSX is based on the Chromium embedded framework and the source code is here: <a href="https://github.com/vibber/CefWithSyphon"  target="_blank">CefWithSyphon on Github</a></p>
<h2>Important note</h2>
<p>Only use Sliider for trusted content. Sliider does not have the security that normally protect you when you browse the web. So don&#8217;t use Sliider for browsing cat movie sites please&#8230;</p>
<h2>Get in touch with me</h2>
<p>Please do get in touch if you&#8217;ve created something fun. Get in touch on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/udart"  target="_blank">Udart Facebook page</a> or submit bugs on the <a href="https://github.com/vibber/Sliider"  target="_blank">Github Sliider page</a>.</p>

The biggest limitation being that we can not use the Syphon input as a texture in WebGL. When I did this I prepared a Syphon client in Quartz Composer and converted it to a Quicktime file. Then I put it into my webpage like this: &#60;embed width="400px" height="300px" name="plugin" src="file:///Syphon%20Client%20QC.mov" type="video/quicktime"&#62; It does seem that we can put CSS filters on the Quicktime element which I hadn&#8217;t expected (tested in Safari and Chrome).

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes apparently we can have a Syphon input into the web browser. It is a workaround done via Quicktime. So it has some limitations. The biggest limitation being that we can not use the Syphon input as a texture in WebGL. When I did this I prepared a Syphon client in Quartz Composer and converted it to a Quicktime file. Then I put it into my webpage like this:</p>
<p><code>&lt;embed width="400px" height="300px" name="plugin" src="file:///Syphon%20Client%20QC.mov" type="video/quicktime"&gt;</code></p>
<p>It does seem that we can put CSS filters on the Quicktime element which I hadn&#8217;t expected (tested in Safari and Chrome). Like this:<br />
<code><br />
&lt;head&gt;<br />
    &lt;style&gt;<br />
        .filtered {<br />
            -webkit-filter: hue-rotate(230deg)<br />
                            saturate(300%)<br />
                            blur(6px);<br />
        }<br />
    &lt;/style&gt;<br />
&lt;/head&gt;<br />
&lt;body&gt;<br />
    &lt;embed class="filtered" width="400px" height="300px" name="plugin" src="Syphon%20Client%20QC.mov" type="video/quicktime"&gt;<br />
&lt;/body&gt;<br />
</code></p>
<p>I have also tested the awesome up-and-coming <a href="http://adobe.github.io/web-platform/samples/css-customfilters/"  target="_blank">CSS custom filters</a> feature but it does not work on videos or embedded content &#8211; yet. I have a hope that when it is implemented for the video tag it will also work for the embed tag. That would finally give us some control over a Syphon input transforming the geometry and style of it as we please.</p>
<p>So what is this all good for? Well basically I would like to use the web browser as a VJing tool. And for visualists Syphon is such a nice tool so this discovery is a good step in the right direction for creating a VJ tool using browser technology.</p>
<p>For anyone wondering this has nothing to do with streaming a Syphon source. It&#8217;s purely an example that is running on the local machine.</p>

<p>I had a hard time finding a headline for this post. The thing is that something is happening in the VJ/visuals world that is getting me very excited. That thing is a new technology on the Mac called <a target="_blank" href="http://syphon.v002.info/" >Syphon</a>. At this point I think only a small circle of programmers and techies are aware of Syphon as it hasn&#8217;t yet been released. I think it&#8217;s going to have a tremendous impact on the way realtime visual apps (think VDMX, Modul8, Resolume) and visual programming environments are going to work in the future. Let me try to explain.</p>
<p><em>Update: As of today November 3rd, there is a  <a target="_blank" href="http://syphon.v002.info/" >public beta</a> for download for Quartz, FreeFrame, Unity 3D and Jitter.</em></p>
<p>Today each visual app or VJ app is like a closed cage. You create your graphics and it is then sent to your monitor, your video projector or whereever. The output of the app is locked. It cannot be altered after it leaves the app.<br />
Imagine you had two apps each producing a live image. Up until now there has been no good way to combine the outputs of those two apps into one image in real time. Like if you created a background in Resolume and a nice particle effect in Modul8. You would have to save one of them as a file and then import the movie into the other app. Or you would have to use a screen grabber to catch the image from Resolume and put it into Modul8 in real time, but that uses a lot of the ressources of your computer and tends to slow down the other apps if you are not careful.</p>
<p>So in reality most people working with real time visuals just get used to preproducing clips and importing them into their favourite VJ app. And in general you just have one visual app open when you perform live. But why should it be like this? Why can&#8217;t you e.g. have one specialized app for producing a nice 3D background and bring that into your favourite VJ app to play with? Or why can&#8217;t you bring the output from your VJ app into another specialized app that puts some final touches onto the image before sending it to the screen?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://syphon.v002.info/" >Syphon</a> seems to bring the answer for this. It is a sort of bridging technology &#8211; Mac only &#8211; that allows applications to &#8216;talk to each other&#8217; and exchange graphics in real time without any delay or loss of image quality. It only works internally in one machine at this point (I think &#8211; Syphon people correct me if I&#8217;m wrong) but it still brings a lot of potential for those who perform with visuals live.</p>
<p>One example of this is the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.modul8.us/?p=474" >MadMapper</a> software. This is currently also in development and has not been released yet. This software allows you to use the output of any Syphon capable app as material for a <a href="http://www.udart.dk/2010/02/17/projection-mapping-on-the-rise/" >mapping installation</a>. The MadMapper allows you to split up the image into areas that can be projected onto an object. In this way you can produce your images live in another app of your choice and then let MadMapper handle the final alignment of the image onto the object.</p>
<p>I hope you can share my excitement here. This is just one example of why we should &#8216;open up the cage&#8217; and set the visuals free. If Syphon catches on I think everybody is gong to benefit from this ability to exchange visuals between applications. My bet is that we will see more specialized applications for live visuals instead of giant VJ apps that try to include every possible feature. This is a good thing in my opinion as I think the overall quality and the number of options available will benefit from this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As visualists have noticed already and known for some time now, projection mapping is cool. And now it seems that this technique is going mainstrem in a big way as it is beginning to be used more and more in commercial contexts. In my city I am noticing more and more outdoor video projections &#8211; some of them using mapping techniques.</p>
<p><em>For those who stumble upon this article and are not familiar with the term, projection mapping is the technique of beaming video (with a standard video projector) onto three dimensional objects and adjusting and masking the image so that it seems to follow the shape of the target object instead of spilling out onto walls etc. The result can be surprisingly effective and eye catching as the video is no longer a flat square on the wall but becomes an object in space &#8211; an animated sculpture if you will.</em></p>
<p>However besides this definition it might be difficult to explain to clients and others outside visualist circles exactly what is the big deal and what is the value of projection mapping and so we need to be able to point to good examples. I&#8217;ve tried to collect a few of my favourites.</p>
<p>The first one I have included because it clearly demonstrates the technique applied to a commercial context perfect for a store interior or a window display. This mapping display was developed for the MINI Cooper store in Paris:</p>
<p><object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=9160619&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=9160619&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/9160619" >Mapping video MINI</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/user657404" >VisionSonore</a> on <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com" >Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>The technique used is simple and affordable for a trained visualist. In the above example the software Modul8, three computers and three video projectors were used. </p>
<p>The technique of projection mapping can be taken much further and the above example does not really show the full potential. Giant outdoor video projections onto buildings using advanced 3d animations creates a stunning faux 3d effect. The example in the video below is not the first work of this kind, it has been technically possible for some years now to deliver projections on this scale, but this new years show is a humourous and well made example:</p>
<p><object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=9490140&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=9490140&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/9490140" >3D Projection Mapping</a> from <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com/anema" >anema</a> on <a target="_blank" href="http://vimeo.com" >Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p>Finally another fun application of the technique onto a tennis court. Actually no advanced 3d here, just some simple 2d graphics. But I like the innovative idea of using the shape of the court. The creators also did use the opportunity to project the classic video game &#8216;Pong&#8217; onto the playing field.</p>
<p><object width="400" height="300"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7774483&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=7774483&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=1&amp;show_byline=1&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="300"></embed></object>
